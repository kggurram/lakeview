# Lakeview - a CPS125 Project

Term Project for CPS125 - Digital Computation and Programming, built using C.

## Requirements

Read a large file of temperatures of each of the 5 Great Lakes and organize them _with dates_ accordingly as solutions to various project questions.

## Project Questions

1. What is the average temperature of all 5 lakes?\
2. What lake had the warmest average temperature? Coldest average?\
3. What are the warmest and coldest temperatures, per lake _and_ overall?\
4. What were the summer average temperatures from warmest to coldest? And Winter?\
5. What days were above 20 degrees Celsius?\
6. What days were below 0 degrees Celsius?

## Additional Challenge

Compile and satisfy every question in aim for the least number of lines of code.
> Our team succeeded to have the shortest program in our class: 201 lines of code.
